# MotorControl
The control box contains up to four 400w / 15A MOSFET boards. Each controller runs independently. An ESP32 provides pins for stepper control, sensors, like temp or pressure sensor, displays, and also includes WIFI and BT. Blync allows no-code app design with drag and drop widgets so anyone can customize it. 
<P>
This goes into a 3d printed enclosure based off the Ultimate Box Creator on Thingverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1264391) I've added parametric options specific to this design. Just simple things - optional OLED display, number of mosfet boards, power switch in the front or back, use DC barrel jacks or aviation connector to control and will post it soon.
<P>
Not including sensors, the parts are under $30.
